                Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha Temple, dedicated to Lord Ayyappa,
                is the most famous and prominent among all the Sastha temples in
                Kerala.
              </p>
              <p>
                The temple is situated on a hilltop (about 3000 feet above sea
                level) named Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district, which is
                unique. The temple is open to people belonging to all religions.
                There is a place near the temple; east of Sannidhanam (the abode
                of Lord Ayyappa), dedicated to Vavar (a close friend of Lord
                Ayyappa) which is called Vavaru Nada, an epitome of religious
                harmony. Another unique aspect of this temple is that it is not
                open throughout the year. It is open for worship only during the
                days of Mandalapooja, Makaravilakku, Vishu and also during the
                first day of every Malayalam month.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is said that the pilgrims have to observe celibacy for 41
                days before going to Sabarimala. Pilgrims take the traditional
                forest routes as well as the one from Pamba which is less
                physically challenging to reach the temple.
