                    <p>Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha Temple, dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, is the most famous and prominent
                        among all the Sastha temples in Kerala.</p>
                    <p>The temple is situated on a hilltop (about 3000 feet above sea level) named Sabarimala in
                        Pathanamthitta district, which is unique. The temple is open to people belonging to all religions.
                        There is a place near the temple; east of Sannidhanam (the abode of Lord Ayyappa), dedicated to
                        Vavar (a close friend of Lord Ayyappa) which is called Vavaru Nada, an epitome of religious harmony.
                        Another unique aspect of this temple is that it is not open throughout the year. It is open for
                        worship only during the days of Mandalapooja, Makaravilakku, Vishu and also during the first day of
                        every Malayalam month.</p>
                    <p>It is said that the pilgrims have to observe celibacy for 41 days before going to Sabarimala.
                        Pilgrims take the traditional forest routes as well as the one from Pamba which is less physically
                        challenging to reach the temple.</p>
